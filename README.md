1.1 Rectangle.zip
  --Create a class Rectangle, which maintains the data about the rectangle (height, width) and the methods returning the area and perimeter.
    Write also the appropriate constructors. Test the class by creating some objects, anonymous objects and invoke the methods.
    
1.2 Patterns.zip
  -- Create a class Pattern, so that it is possible to execute the following code:
     Pattern p1 = new Pattern();
     Pattern p2 = new Pattern(’o’,’$’,5);
     System.out.println(p1.giveDescription());
     p1.print();
     System.out.println(p2.giveDescription());
     p2.print();
     p1.changeData(’-’,’+’,7);
     p1.print();
     The result should be as follows:
     Pattern: 1 x (?,?).
     ??
     Pattern: 5 x (o,$).
     o$o$o$o$o$
